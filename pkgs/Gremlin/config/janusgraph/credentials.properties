# JanusGraph Credentials Database Configuration
#
# This is NOT a username:password file. It's a full JanusGraph graph
# configuration that stores credentials in vertices/edges.
#
# MUST use a DIFFERENT storage location than your main graph.
# The authenticator will create a graph here to store user credentials
# as vertices with hashed passwords.

# Storage backend for credentials - SEPARATE from main graph
