# 𝔐𝔦̈𝔪𝔦𝔰

𝔐𝔦̈𝔪𝔦𝔰 is a collaborative “filesystem” for IPFS resources. It varies from a traditional direcotry tree in the following ways:

* **Context Forest:** In a regular filesystem, each file exists at a single point in the tree. In 𝔐𝔦̈𝔪𝔦𝔰 *every* reasonable path for a resource resolves.
* **Pathsets:** When searching through resources, rather than a single path, the user can specify combinations of paths, and display elements that are common between them.
* **Collaborative Filter:** In 𝔐𝔦̈𝔪𝔦𝔰, each user's additions are saved to their own subforest. These are traversed en masse to find which resources were the most often referenced to gauge popularity.
* **Native Collections:** Folders may contain multiple resources with the same name.
