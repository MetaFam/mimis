Mïmisbrunnr
===========

Mimis is essentially Freenet sans encryption running over [WebRTC](http://webrtc.org)'s DataChannels. So participating in the network is as easy as opening a webpage.

The characteristic I want to borrow from Freebase is predictive caching. The network is constantly trying to guess as to what will be needed beforehand.

I want to base it on a distributed hashtable built on WebRTC, but that doesn't exist yet.

Mïmis holds the memesphere which is all the digitized information.
