It leverages <a href="https://ipfs.io">IPFS</a> to store files & transfer state for a <a href="https://neo4j.org">Neo4j</a> graph describing the connections between files.</p> <img src="architecture.svg" alt="Mïmis Architecture" class="svelte-cwls5q"/> <p class="svelte-cwls5q">The structure in Neo4j differs from a traditional file system in several ways:</p> <ul class="svelte-cwls5q"><li class="svelte-cwls5q"><p class="svelte-cwls5q">Files have no names. All the context information is contained in the path leading to the data.</p> <p class="svelte-cwls5q">Much of the structure of the system is in equivalencies between paths:</p> <ul class="svelte-cwls5q"><li class="svelte-cwls5q"><p class="svelte-cwls5q">Some are simple formatting, like <code>∅/book/by/Elizabeth Bear/Shoggoths in Bloom/</code> & <code>∅/book/Elizabeth Bear — Shoggoths in Bloom/</code>. Ideally, <em>any</em> reasonable path should resolve to the resource it represents.</p></li> <li class="svelte-cwls5q"><p class="svelte-cwls5q">Others, convey semantic information, like having <code>∅/Hugo/Novella/2009/winner/</code> or <code>∅/top/science-fiction/#23/</code> be an equivalency to the above paths.</p></li></ul></li> <li class="svelte-cwls5q"><p class="svelte-cwls5q">Each position in the context graph holds <em>(optionally)</em>:</p> <ul class="svelte-cwls5q"><li class="svelte-cwls5q"><p class="svelte-cwls5q">A combination of:</p> <ul class="svelte-cwls5q"><li class="svelte-cwls5q"><p class="svelte-cwls5q">An ordered list of Nöopoints <em>(the Nöosphere is all ideas, a point within that space is a particular concept)</em>. Each Nöopoint represents a different concept that could be meant by the paths leading to this list.</p> <p class="svelte-cwls5q">For each Nöopoint, there are blobs whose contents are in IPFS, at most one per mimetype.</p></li> <li class="svelte-cwls5q"><p class="svelte-cwls5q">An ordered list of mounted contexts. Each user has their own tree differentiated by an Ethereum signing key. A user can mark positions in their tree as equivalent to positions in others' trees.</p> <p class="svelte-cwls5q">There are multiple access modes which combine the lists in different ways. For example, one algorithm might take the first requested resource encountered while another might present a list where each subsequent mount is deduplicated & concatenated to the previous ones.</p></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul> <p class="svelte-cwls5q">One function of that these ordered lists will enable is a content recommender. Users can create ordered lists at different context points, and they're combined & collated to generate a likely list of the consensus opinion.</p> <p class="svelte-cwls5q">Graphs are serialized to DAG-JSON for communication between instances. DAG-JSON cannot handle cycles in the graph. For this reason, all links are "forward" from the current location. There is a special path element, <code>∅</code>, that represents the search should drop back to root of the shared file system. When the system is serialized, if they create cycles, paths containing "<code>∅</code>" are unrolled and saved as though <code>∅</code> is just a normal directory.</p></section>`);function v(t){var l=h();n(o=>{var a=r();i.title="About Mïmis",c(2),e(o,a)}),e(t,l)}export{v as component};
