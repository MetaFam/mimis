It leverages <a href="https://ipfs.io">IPFS</a> to store files & transfer state for a <a href="https://neo4j.org">Neo4j</a> graph describing the connections between files.</p> <img src="architecture.svg" alt="Mïmis Architecture" class="svelte-14u335l"/> <p class="svelte-14u335l">The structure in Neo4j differs from a traditional file system in several ways:</p> <ul><li><p class="svelte-14u335l">Files have no names. All the context information is contained in the path leading to the data.</p> <p class="svelte-14u335l">Much of the structure of the system is in equivalencies between paths:</p> <ul><li><p class="svelte-14u335l">Some are simple formatting, like <code>∅/book/by/Elizabeth Bear/Shoggoths in Bloom/</code> & <code>∅/book/Elizabeth Bear — Shoggoths in Bloom/</code>. Ideally, <em>any</em> reasonable path should resolve to the resource it represents.</p></li> <li><p class="svelte-14u335l">Others, convey semantic information, like having <code>∅/Hugo/Novella/2009/winner/</code> or <code>∅/top/science-fiction/#23/</code> be an equivalency to the above paths.</p></li></ul></li> <li><p class="svelte-14u335l">Each position in the context graph holds <em>(optionally)</em>:</p> <ul><li><p class="svelte-14u335l">One of:</p> <ul><li><p class="svelte-14u335l">An ordered list of Nöopoints <em>(the Nöosphere is all ideas, a point within that space is a particular concept)</em>. Each Nöopoint represents a different concept that could be meant by the paths leading to this list.</p></li> <li><p class="svelte-14u335l">For each Nöopoint, there are blobs whose contents are in IPFS, at most one per mimetype.</p></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul> <p class="svelte-14u335l">Each user has their own tree, and it is possible to browse and subscribe to sections of other users' trees. These subscriptions can be "union mounted" into a composite tree beginning with the user's tree, and merging mounted nodes into it.</p> <p class="svelte-14u335l">When a context path is ambiguous, the system can be requested to return the highest-priority answer or an ordered list of possible candidate resources.</p> <p class="svelte-14u335l">One function of that these ordered lists will enable is a content recommender. Users can create ordered lists at different context points, and they're combined & collated to generate a likely list of the consensus opinion.</p> <p class="svelte-14u335l">Structurally, the context tree differs from a traditional filesystem in that files don't have names, per se. Their "name" is simply the file type. <em>(Oftentimes, this is duplicated, like <code inert>svg.svg</code> because a variety of softwares rely on there being an extension.)</em> Because there is no context information in the filename, it is possible to create multiple routes to a file without the fear that the filename relies on context in the leading path.</p> <p class="svelte-14u335l">The goal is that the tree should contain a variety of paths describing a resource rather than a single fixed point.</p> <p class="svelte-14u335l"></p></section>`);function f(s){var i=h();r(o=>{var a=c();l.title="About Mïmis",n(2),e(o,a)}),e(s,i)}export{f as component};
