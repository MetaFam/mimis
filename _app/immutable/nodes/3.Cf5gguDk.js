These subscriptions can be "mounted" into a composite tree beginning with the user's tree and merging mounted nodes into it.</p> <p>When a context path is ambiguous, the system can be requested to return an ordered list of possible candidate resources.</p> <p>One function of that these ordered lists will enable is a content recommender. Users can create ordered lists ast different context points, and they're combined & collated to generate a likely list of the consensus opinion.</p> <p>Structurally, the context tree differs from a traditional filesystem in that files don't have names, per se. Their "name" is simply the file type. <em>(Oftentimes, this is duplicated, like <code>svg.svg</code> because a variety of softwares rely on there being an extension.)</em> Because there is no context information in the filename, it is possible to create multiple routes to a file without the fear that the filename relies on context in the leading path.</p> <p>The goal is that the tree should contain a variety of paths describing a resource.</p></section>`);function y(s){var o=d();c(i=>{var a=p();r.title="About Mïmis",e(i,a)}),e(s,o)}export{y as component,v as universal};
